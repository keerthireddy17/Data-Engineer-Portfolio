Hello, I’m Keerthi Reddy K!

I am a Data Engineer with over 3+ years of experience in business intelligence, data analytics, and engineering. My journey began with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from CBIT, where I developed a strong foundation in programming and project management. This foundation was further strengthened by my M.S. in Business Analytics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I delved deep into big data analytics, data science, and business intelligence.

In my professional experience at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I’ve excelled in roles that required not just technical proficiency but also analytical thinking. As a Programmer Analyst, I’ve consolidated risk data across departments, designed interactive dashboards, and conducted in-depth market research, directly contributing to business decisions and performance improvements. My technical toolkit includes SQL, Python, PySpark, Apache Kafka, Apache Kudu, Tableau, Power BI, and a variety of big data and cloud tools. I’ve successfully migrated terabytes of data, optimized complex data pipelines, and developed utilities that significantly reduced manual errors.

I’m driven by the challenge of uncovering the stories hidden within data and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. Whether I’m optimizing a data pipeline, designing a predictive model, or exploring new cloud technologies, I’m always eager to push the boundaries of what data can do.

If you’re looking for a Data Engineer with a unique blend of business intelligence and data engineering skills, I’d love to connect.

Let’s explore how I can contribute to your next data-driven project.

My journey into the world of data truly began during my time at CTS. Working on large-scale data projects, I was amazed by the power and potential of data to drive decisions, uncover insights, and solve complex problems. This experience sparked my passion for Data Engineering, as I saw firsthand how data could be transformed into a valuable asset. My fascination with data grew as I learned to build and optimize data pipelines, manage vast datasets, and use advanced tools to ensure seamless data flow across systems. This realization led me to fully embrace Data Engineering as my career path.
