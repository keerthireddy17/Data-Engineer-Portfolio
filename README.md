Hello, I’m Keerthi Reddy K!

I am a Data Engineer with over 3+ years of experience in business intelligence, data analytics, and engineering. My journey began with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from CBIT, where I developed a strong foundation in programming and project management. This foundation was further strengthened by my M.S. in Business Analytics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I delved deep into big data analytics, data science, and business intelligence.

In my professional experience at Cognizant Technology Solutions, I’ve excelled in roles that required not just technical proficiency but also analytical thinking. As a Programmer Analyst, I’ve consolidated risk data across departments, designed interactive dashboards, and conducted in-depth market research, directly contributing to business decisions and performance improvements. My technical toolkit includes SQL, Python, PySpark, Apache Kafka, Apache Kudu, Tableau, Power BI, and a variety of big data and cloud tools. I’ve successfully migrated terabytes of data, optimized complex data pipelines, and developed utilities that significantly reduced manual errors.

I’m driven by the challenge of uncovering the stories hidden within data and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. Whether I’m optimizing a data pipeline, designing a predictive model, or exploring new cloud technologies, I’m always eager to push the boundaries of what data can do.

If you’re looking for a Data Engineer with a unique blend of business intelligence and data engineering skills, I’d love to connect.

Let’s explore how I can contribute to your next data-driven project.


<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Why Data Engineering and Beyond?</h3>

My journey into the world of data truly began during my time at CTS. Working on large-scale data projects, I was amazed by the power and potential of data to drive decisions, uncover insights, and solve complex problems. This experience sparked my passion for Data Engineering, as I saw firsthand how data could be transformed into a valuable asset. My fascination with data grew as I learned to build and optimize data pipelines, manage vast datasets, and use advanced tools to ensure seamless data flow across systems. This realization led me to fully embrace Data Engineering as my career path.

<strong>Housing Price Prediction</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using a detailed machine learning approach. Key tasks include improving data quality through preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling missing values. The project employs Linear Regression for prediction, applies log transformations to stabilize variance, and uses the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to address multicollinearity. Visualizations in Tableau complement the analysis, providing actionable insights.

<strong>Objective:</strong>

To develop a robust regression model that accurately predicts median California home prices based on factors such as location, housing attributes, economic indicators, and demographics. Evaluate the model's performance with statistical metrics and visualizations.

<strong>Skills:</strong>

Data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression analysis, model evaluation, data visualization

<strong>Technology:</strong>

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn

<strong>Results:</strong>

The regression model achieved a high R-squared value, indicating strong performance in predicting median housing prices. Key findings include a moderate positive correlation between median income and housing prices (0.69), suggesting higher incomes lead to more expensive homes. Housing characteristics such as median age and total rooms show weak positive correlations with prices, while location features like latitude and longitude exhibit weak negative correlations. Population density also has a weak negative correlation with housing prices. These results highlight the significance of socioeconomic and geographic factors in determining home prices.
